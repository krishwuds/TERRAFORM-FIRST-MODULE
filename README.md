Certainly! Here's a sample `README.md` file that you can include in your GitHub repository to provide documentation for your Terraform-created EC2 instance:

# Terraform EC2 Instance

This repository contains the Terraform configuration files and instructions to create an Amazon EC2 instance on AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- AWS account credentials configured on your machine using AWS CLI or environment variables.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-ec2-instance.git
   cd terraform-ec2-instance
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform in the project directory:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. Customize the EC2 instance configuration by editing the `variables.tf` file, if necessary.

4. Review and adjust the `main.tf` file with any additional resources or settings you need.

5. Deploy the EC2 instance by running:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the deployment when prompted.

6. Once the EC2 instance is created, you can find its public IP address and other information in the Terraform output.

## Cleaning Up

To destroy the EC2 instance and associated resources, run the following command:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
